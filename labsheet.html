This lab introduces the use of Windows Server. You are going to install your first copy of Windows Server 2016
You will need a Windows Server 2016 R2 ISO and a product key. The ISO should be on the d: drive of the lab computer and
you can use a KMS key from <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/jj612867.aspx">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/jj612867.aspx</a>
You can download the ISOs used in this module, as well as VMware Workstation from onethehub.com. Details are on Blackboard in the useful links section.

If you have never used VMware before then I suggest you watch 
<a href="https://www.lynda.com/Fusion-tutorials/Installing-VMware-Workstation/163066/175191-4.html?org=uclan.ac.uk">this</a>. You do not need to install VMware Workstation 
in the lab as it is already installed.
</p>
<ol id="instructions">
  <li>Start VMware workstation and click 'Create a New Virtual Machine'. Select 'Typical (recommended)' and click next.</li>
