  <li>A local college has just finished a new building to house a Computing Department.  The college needs to setup 5 networked teaching labs. Each lab is 
required
to support between 20 and 25 computers and must be on a separate network. You have been given the following network address:
203.168.15.0/24</li>
<ol>
  <li>Calculate the appropriate subnet mask required; the number of valid subnets produced and the number of valid hosts produced for each subnet.</li>
  <li>Calculate the first, the last valid host ID, and the broadcast address in each of the subnets.</li>
  <li>Calculate ALL the valid subnets.</li>
  <li>Calculate the first, the last valid host ID, and the broadcast address in each of the subnets.</li>

<div class="subtitle">Scenario</div>
<p>
You need to work in groups 
</p>
<p>
An international manufacturing company that makes car parts. Among the components that are made, break disks and part of the car engine. The company uses a 
number of machines that use high voltage. The company employs 45 people; 25 people working in the shop floor and the rest are distributed among the management 
(5 people), sales (9 people), admin (5 people), Human Resources (1 person). The company occupies a building with several floors. You were approached by the 
company to deploy a network that satisfies its operational needs. A report needs to be submitted that includes all the hardware and software and operational 
needs. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You need to decide on the hardware and software to be used.</li>
  <li>You need to provide costing for the project which would include the set up and running costs.</li> 
  <li>You need to provide a network diagram.</li>
  <li>You need to provide an addressing scheme.</li>
  <li>Make sure to plan your system for future expansion.</li>
  <li>Justify your choices.</li>
  <li>You may make assumptions where appropriate.</li>
